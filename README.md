## Requirements
Python 3.x
Tkinter library
Installation
The application can be run by executing the OrbitalSpeedCalculator.py file. No additional installation is required.

## Usage
To use the Orbital Speed Calculator, simply run the OrbitalSpeedCalculator.py file and follow the instructions on the screen. Enter the radius of the orbit in kilometers and press the "Calculate" button. The orbital speed will be displayed in km/s.

## Formula
The orbital speed is calculated using the formula: v = sqrt(Œº / r), where Œº is the standard gravitational parameter and r is the radius.

## Limitations
The Orbital Speed Calculator is intended for educational purposes only and is not suitable for use in actual space missions. The calculations are based on simplified models and may not accurately reflect the real-world behavior of objects in space.
